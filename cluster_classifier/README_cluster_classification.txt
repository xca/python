README

Each python file uses Bing API to get the corresponding search results. The search results might be different on different trials. 

Each python file contains their own main function; therefore they can be run by themselves. Please put all data files in the same folder with the python code when running. 

All code used requests, numpy and other standard python libraries. Please install them before running.
